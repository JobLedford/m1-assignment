        Here at Job's Doggie Adoption we offer some of the best care for
        animals. We have a rescue where we get our animals and then we treat
        them for any ailments that they may have. After they are feeling better,
        then we get them ready for adoption. Come in today and check out some of
        our beautiful & friendly animals!<br>
        These are some pictures of our lovely workers & animals. If youre
        interested in adoption, please check out the dogs tab. Please fill out
        the form so we have your contact & profile information.

      <h2>Establied in 2019...</h2>
      <p>This adoption center was established in 2019 after founder, Job Ledford, found a dog on the side of the road one night. The dog was hurt and hungry, it touched Job's heart and he acted on that. He got the dog and saved it, and provided it with a nice place to stay while waiting on his forever home. After that day, Job began to help animals everywhere. There is almost no animal he will not try to help.</p>
